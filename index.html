            <p>An aspiring robotics professional must be highly passionate to learn and be actively involved in various problem-solving environments with robust skills in presentation, research, communication, and detailed knowledge of programming languages, as well as physical engineering. Robotics is a multidisciplinary technology that combines mechanical, electrical, computer science, and many other fields together. Improving programming and innovation is helping robots to discover their way into various fields, which are excessively risky, dull, or unimaginable for humans to accomplish..</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <img src="project2.jpg.png" alt="Project 2">
            <p>This project integrates aspects of robotics, computer vision, and of course chess. And don’t worry! It’s very easy to set up, the code is written in Python and every step of the project is explained in this tutorial series, so it’s perfect for those who don’t have much experience in the field. It uses a camera and a visual recognition system running on a Raspberry Pi to detect the movements of chess pieces in the game. It uses Stockfish as a chess engine to validate the human player’s moves and decide which move the robot will make, then it uses all this information to transcribe the game in a graphical user interface that shows the game state and allows you to configure all the aspects of it, for example, at the start of the game it allows you to calibrate the camera and choose which color you would like to play with. It does not require any special chess board or pieces; in fact, the GUI allows you to enter the dimensions of your board so you can play without making any changes to the code or having to make a custom board</p>
